        <h3>Fried Chicken Tips</h3>
        <p>How long does chicken take to fry?

            Typically, chicken should be fried for about 7-8 minutes per side. But keep in mind that pieces can vary in size and thickness. The chicken is fully cooked when the thickest part of the meat registers at 165° and the skin is crispy and dark golden-brown in color. Discover even more tasty fried chicken dishes.
            What oil should I use for frying?
            
            Neutral oils like canola, vegetable and peanut oil have higher smoke points, making them ideal for frying chicken. Learn more about selecting the right oil for frying.
            Should you soak chicken in milk before frying?
            
            Yes, we recommend soaking chicken in milk before frying! Brining the chicken in buttermilk before frying will give you moist and juicy results. The acid in the buttermilk helps break down the protein in the chicken, creating tender meat. Try this method with this picnic fried chicken recipe.
